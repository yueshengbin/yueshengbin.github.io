I am Shengbin Yue (å²³åœ£æ–Œ), a Ph.D. student at Fudan University. Iâ€™m a member of the [Fudan NLP Group](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpen/main.htm) and [DISC Lab](http://www.fudan-disc.com/), and very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhongyu Wei](http://www.fudan-disc.com/people/zywei) and [Prof. Wei Lin](https://iics.fudan.edu.cn/41/d7/c33358a410071/page.htm).


Research Interests
======
My work spans Natural Language Processing and Multi-modal Learning. Iâ€™m particularly excited about these research thrusts:
* ðŸ¤– LLM-driven multi-agent systems. 
* ðŸ“¸ Vision-and-language content analysis. 

Recent News
